# ML Regression <> Level 3

In this challenge, you will build your own regression model with decision trees to analyze your chosen data set. The challenge will test your proficiency across the Machine Learning: Regression skillset. 

## Requirements

In order for the project to be considered "completed", it must complete the following requirements:

# 1. Data Preparation and Exploration: The student must perform thorough exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand the features, data types, and any patterns or relationships in the dataset.
The dataset should be cleaned (e.g., handling missing data, removing outliers, etc.), and the features should be preprocessed as needed (e.g., normalization, encoding categorical variables, etc.).Submit visualizations (scatter plots, histograms, correlation heatmaps, etc.) to illustrate the relationships between features and the target variable.
# 2. Model Implementation: 
# 3. 3. Performance Evaluation: Evaluate the model using appropriate regression metrics, such as: Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), and R-squared (RÂ²). Analyze overfitting/underfitting issues by comparing performance on training and test datasets. Consider using techniques such as cross-validation to improve the robustness of the model.
# 4. Model Optimization: Optimize the model by adjusting hyperparameters (e.g., max_depth, min_samples_split) and testing their effects on model performance. Optionally, apply techniques such as grid search or random search to find the best hyperparameters for the model. Students should clearly explain why certain optimizations were made and how they impacted the model.
# 5. Visualization and Interpretation: Visualize the decision tree structure and include a discussion on feature importance. Provide visualizations of actual vs. predicted values to help assess model performance.Explain how well the model generalizes to unseen data and identify potential improvements that could be made.
# 6. Reflection and Model Limitations: Discuss the strengths and weaknesses of using a decision tree regression model for the chosen dataset. Reflect on potential next steps, including the use of more advanced models (e.g., Random Forest, Gradient Boosting) if necessary. Address any biases or limitations of the dataset or model that could affect real-world usage.

## Submission

All code must be submitted as a [PR (pull request)](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request#creating-the-pull-request) following the PR template that will autogenerate when a PR is made

It may take Learning Ambassadors up to 1-2 weeks to grade your solution and give any feedback/badges associated with this challenge. However, if it takes longer than 2 weeks, please send an email to sparkttl@bu.edu.

## Contributing

See something in the docs that is unclear or think that this level 3 could use any more requirements? Please create a PR that follows the `open-src.md` template and we will get back to you!
